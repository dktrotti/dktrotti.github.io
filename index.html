			<h2>Skills</h2>
		</div>
		<h3>Object Oriented Design</h3>
		<p class="skilldesc">
			As a result of my coursework and previous jobs, I have become proficient in object
			oriented design using C#, Java, and Python. This skill has proven to be highly useful
			in my academic, personal, and professional projects. I have developed a variety of
			applications ranging from simple monitoring tools to full featured system management
			utilities with database integration and complex filtering.
		</p>
		<h3>Database Systems</h3>
		<p class="skilldesc">
			I have taken several courses on the topic of database systems and information retrieval
			systems. These courses have allowed me a further understanding of the formal
			expressions of information system concepts. Over the course of my work terms, I have
			become comfortable using a variety of database management systems including Microsoft
			SQL Server and Oracle Database. This combination of formal knowledge and practical
			experience has repeatedly proven to be an asset during work terms and personal projects.
		</p>
		<h3>Software Testing</h3>
		<p class="skilldesc">
			During my academic terms and co-op work terms, I have had many opportunities to make
			use of a variety of automated testing frameworks such as NUnit, Visual Studio Unit
			Tests, and Python's unittest module. These frameworks have allowed me to write more
			reliable code, and have helped me to design my projects through the application of test
			driven development. I also have experience with integration testing and testing code
			manually to ensure correct functionality.
		</p>
		<h3>Mobile Development</h3>
		<p class="skilldesc">
			I have developed several Android apps, both working on my own and working with a team.
			These apps have required diverse functionality, ranging from processing search data to
			retrieving and processing location data. This experience has allowed me to explore many
			different topics including parsing json files, working with protocol buffers, and
			interacting with RESTful APIs.
		</p>
		<h3>Functional Programming</h3>
		<p class="skilldesc">
			Through my coursework, I have had several opportunities to work within a functional
			programming paradigm. While I mainly used Lisp and Prolog, I was able to learn many
			skills that can be used in other languages. By learning a different programming
			paradigm, I am able to find different solutions to problems that I would not have
			otherwise considered.
